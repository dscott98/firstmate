  Enter quiet supervision mode when the captain invokes /quiet or asks for quiet mode, quiet-while-present, or fewer routine wake turns while they stay in the session.
  It sets the same durable away/quiet-mode flag as /afk, in `quiet` mode, so the sub-supervisor daemon self-handles routine wakes and escalates captain-relevant events exactly as away mode does, but ordinary captain chat does NOT exit it - only an explicit `/quiet off` does.

# quiet

Quiet supervision mode (kunchenguid/firstmate#2356): the same token-saving
daemon tradeoff as `/afk`, made explicit for a captain who is staying,
watching the session, and does not want to exit the mode just by chatting.

This skill is a thin wrapper.
Every mechanism below - the daemon, its injection, its busy/composer guards,
its classification policy, its reliability properties - is owned once by the
`afk` skill and is IDENTICAL in quiet mode; nothing here restates it.
The only things quiet mode changes are which mode the flag declares and what
exits it.

## What it does

On Pi and pi-signed, use the attended supervision branch without entering an away posture or launching a daemon; [the AFK skill's per-harness entry](../afk/SKILL.md#entering-afk-words) owns this distinction.
The daemon procedure below applies only to the other supported harnesses.

1. **Enter the lifecycle through `bin/fm-afk-launch.sh`, exactly as `/afk`
   does, with `FM_AFK_MODE=quiet` set first.**
   Follow [the AFK entry procedure](../afk/SKILL.md#entering-afk-words), including the confirmed record prerequisite and the per-harness daemon path, with one addition: export `FM_AFK_MODE=quiet` in the shell that invokes `bin/fm-afk-launch.sh start` (or `start-native`), so `state/.afk`'s first line reads `quiet` instead of `away`.
   Leaving `FM_AFK_MODE` unset on a bare refresh of an already-running quiet
   daemon is also correct and does nothing wrong: `fm_afk_flag_write`
   preserves the on-disk mode when no explicit mode is given, so a plain
   `/afk`-shaped refresh call never resets quiet back to away underneath the
   captain.

2. **Acknowledge** in `AGENTS.md` section 9 language: "Captain, quiet mode is
   active; I will batch routine updates and surface only decisions, failures,
   credentials, or review-ready work - ordinary chat will not exit this, say
   `/quiet off` when you want normal per-wake responses back."

## How to exit quiet mode

Unlike `/afk`, ordinary chat is never the exit signal - that is the entire
point of this mode (AGENTS.md section 8's away-mode stub, quiet branch).

- Only an explicit `/quiet off` (or the captain plainly asking to leave quiet
  mode / resume normal supervision) exits it: run `bin/fm-afk-return.sh`
  unchanged, following [the AFK return procedure](../afk/SKILL.md#how-to-exit-the-return).
  That script does not read or care about the flag's mode, so it needs no
  quiet-specific variant.
- A marked daemon escalation, or a message beginning `/quiet` while already
  in quiet mode (refresh, not exit) -> stay in quiet mode and process it, the
  same two carve-outs `/afk` documents for away mode.
- Every other message while in quiet mode is simply answered as ordinary
  work; the flag and daemon are left untouched.

## Orthogonal to approval authority

Identical to `/afk`: quiet mode changes how aggressively firstmate surfaces
things, never who approves what.
A PR ready for merge keeps the merge authority from `AGENTS.md` section 7, and
a needs-decision finding keeps the `ask-user-authority` policy.

## Must not hide a decision or a failure

Per the issue's own author triage: quiet mode is presentation only.
Progress, retries, and internal mechanics stay below deck exactly as in away
mode, but review-ready work, findings, decisions, failures, and credentials
escalate every time, through the same classification policy `/afk` owns.
Quiet mode is opt-in and never the unconsented default; only an explicit
`/quiet` invocation enters it.
