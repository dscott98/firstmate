#
# A sandbox task is an ordinary ship or scout whose worker runs in a one-task
# Firstmate home on a disposable host, which the supervising primary reaches
# through bin/fm-on.sh's task route (bin/fm-remote-route-lib.sh). This script
# is that home's host-side control plane and follows
# bin/fm-remote-secondmate-control.sh: every verb but provision first validates
# the home's .fm-task-home marker for <id>, runs the ordinary host-local script
# under explicit FM_HOME, state, data, config, and projects overrides naming
# the task home, and prints a schema-tagged block where it reports an identity.
# Lifecycle code runs where the files are: launch, control, crew-state, and
# retire are this host's own fm-spawn.sh, fm-control.sh, fm-crew-state.sh, and
# fm-teardown.sh, never a reimplementation. Nothing here calls the sandbox
# provider, and nothing here removes a worktree except fm-teardown.sh behind
# its landed-work test. docs/remote-sandboxes.md owns the operator view.
#
# Every block is key=value lines opening with schema=fm-remote-task-control.v1.
#
# provision reads a fm-remote-task-provision.v1 manifest, at most 1 MiB, on
# stdin: one key=value line per field, each field at most once, any other
# field refused.
#   schema=fm-remote-task-provision.v1

#   pi_auth_b64=<base64 JSON object>  optional Pi API-key provider entries,
#                                     only for a pi or pi-signed harness;
#                                     each provider object requires type=api_key
#                                     and a nonempty string key, permits only
#                                     an optional env object of string values,
#                                     and refuses OAuth and all other fields
#   gh_token_b64=<base64 token>       optional per-repository GitHub token
# It clones the project from its origin, runs no-mistakes init for a
# no-mistakes ship, and writes the brief, the registry line, the named config,
# config/backlog-backend as manual - so this host's spawn and teardown skip the
# backlog transition that belongs to the primary - and the credentials. The
# .fm-task-home marker is written last: it commits the provision and records the
# task identity launch uses and the manifest's SHA-256. The home is created mode
# 0700. Re-running the same manifest changes nothing and reports
# provision=current; a home marked for another task, another manifest for this
# task, and an unmarked home with any content are refused. A failed provision
# removes everything it created and restores the credential files it changed.
# Prints provision=created|current, task_id, and manifest_sha256.
#
# Credentials are Pi API-key providers and the GitHub token, and nothing else
# is accepted, so no Claude credential can reach a sandbox. They arrive only on
# stdin and are written only here: the Pi entries are merged into the account's
# ~/.pi/agent/auth.json and the token is stored in the account's gh configuration
# for github.com via gh auth login --insecure-storage --with-token on stdin.
# Credential files are mode 0600. Failed provision restores the previous Pi
# and gh configuration. gh is required when a GitHub token is supplied.
# The clone and its worktrees use the absolute gh auth git-credential helper,
# scoped to https://github.com, with the same helper passed to the clone.
# No token enters argv, URLs, Git config, the launch environment, or output.
# state/task-provision.journal records steps and credential names only.
#
# launch runs this host's fm-spawn.sh for the provisioned ship or scout on tmux
# and prints the route block - backend, target, worktree, branch (empty for a
# scout), spawn_gen, busy_gen, harness, model, and effort - read back from the
# task record the spawn published. A worker that is already running reports its
# route again; any other existing endpoint is refused, because its worktree may
# hold work that only control relaunch preserves.
#
# state prints the endpoint's recovery-grade agent state (bin/fm-backend.sh),
# missing when the task has no record. observe is one bounded call per watcher
# cadence and prints now and boot (this host's clock and boot time), agent,
# busy and busy_source (bin/fm-busy-lib.sh's classification), pane_hash (of the
# last 40 pane lines, as the watcher hashes them), worktree_write (the newest
# regular-file mtime in the worktree under the watcher's prune list, depth, and
# time bound from bin/fm-classify-lib.sh), and inbox_oldest with
# inbox_oldest_at (the oldest unacknowledged steering record and its mtime); a
# field that cannot be read is unknown and an absent one none.
#
# capture, send, and key match the secondmate control script: a bounded pane
# capture, a steer written idempotently into the task's own steering inbox and
# announced by its doorbell (bin/fm-task-inbox-lib.sh), and one named key
# through fm-send.sh. A task steer carries no correlation token, so send takes
# the 16-hex request id the primary minted for it: a retry of that request
# lands on its existing record, even one already acknowledged, while an
# identical steer under a new id is a new record, and an id already keying a
# different steer is refused.
#
# crew-state prints crew_state, this host's fm-crew-state.sh line computed with
# the status log left out - its run-step attribution or its pane fallback -
# because the primary's mirrored status log is the authoritative fold, plus
# busy and busy_source. head prints branch (empty when detached), head, and
# dirty (yes for any uncommitted or untracked change).
#
# control runs this host's fm-control.sh. interrupt and exit relay its output
# and status. relaunch keeps the recorded harness, model, or effort given as -,
# clears a model or effort given as default, takes the progress note fm-control
# requires as its last argument, and prints the route block from the record the
# relaunch republished.
#
# brief-update replaces data/<id>/brief.md with the brief on stdin, because a
# relaunch reads the brief on disk, and prints brief=updated and brief_sha256.
# Provision and brief-update refuse a brief whose status-append command names
# any status file but this home's own (bin/fm-brief-heading-lib.sh), which
# bin/fm-spawn.sh refuses again at launch.
#
# retire runs this host's fm-teardown.sh for a ship, landed-work test and all,
# and relays its output and status unchanged, so a refusal reaches the
# primary's teardown as written; --force passes through only as the captain's
# explicit discard. A scout is refused, because its worktree is scratch and its
# completion gate runs in the supervising home. Only a passing teardown writes
# state/<id>.retired, so a retry after SSH exit 255 (unknown completion) prints
# already-retired.
