# tests/fm-watch-sandbox-observe.test.sh - the watcher's supervision of a
# sandbox task through its host's observe verb (bin/fm-watch.sh's
# sandbox_observe_check).
#
# A real fm-watch.sh runs against a home holding one sandbox task record. Its
# transport is the real bin/fm-on.sh, whose FM_SSH_BIN seam is a fake ssh that
# answers the host's observe, ring, and crew-state verbs from files the test
# writes, or fails with SSH exit 255 while the case's ssh-down file exists. A
# logging tmux on PATH records any local endpoint read, which a sandbox task
# must never get. The cases pin:
#   - remote calls ride the observe cadence, never the ordinary poll;
#   - an unchanging observed pane surfaces as an ordinary stale wake;
#   - a VM-side dead or missing agent is reported once per incarnation, and the
#     report names the reboot-proven relaunch only when the host has rebooted;
#   - no observation runs while a spawn still placing the task or a control
#     action holds it;
#   - an unreachable host is unknown: one keyed check wake per failure streak,
#     never a stale or dead wake;
#   - the steering re-ring ladder rings through the host's ring verb, waits on a
#     busy worker, and escalates a spent budget or a gone agent;
#   - the wedge timer's worktree-write deferral reads the host's write field.
